<p>As high-performance computing (HPC) systems grow increasingly heterogeneous and application workloads become more diverse, achieving both 
high performance and energy efficiency poses a significant challenge. While performance optimization remains essential, energy efficiency 
has emerged as a critical priority due to substantial infrastructure demands, operational costs, and environmental impact. This project 
tackles two fundamental barriers to energy-conscious HPC: power waste in heterogeneous hardware and the lack of dynamic power coordination. 
It develops a holistic framework, EcoHPC, to enable energy-efficient execution of hybrid workloads on heterogeneous systems. The anticipated 
outcomes have broad scientific, economic, and environmental impacts. Additionally, an integrated education plan aims to train the next 
generation of the HPC workforce.</p>

<p>The project introduces three core technical innovations. First, it exploits collaborative filtering-based recommendation systems that 
combine offline analysis with real-time profiling to model application performance–power trade-offs and guide scheduling decisions. 
Second, it applies multi-objective optimization and Pareto-front analysis to treat power as a first-class schedulable resource, enabling 
system-wide coordination and optimization. Third, it develops adaptive runtime systems that dynamically predict application phases and resource 
demands, allowing applications to minimize power waste while maximizing performance under power constraints. Together, these innovations yield 
new workload models, energy-aware allocation methods, and runtime strategies that significantly enhance energy efficiency in heterogeneous computing environments.</p>
