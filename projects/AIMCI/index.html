<p>Advanced cyberinfrastructure (CI) is undergoing disruptive changes in system architectures and application workloads. The landscape of 
cyberinfrastructure workloads is rapidly expanding beyond traditional computational simulations to include a hybrid mix of applications. CI 
facilities now host diverse high-performance systems with heterogeneous configurations, leading to a complex mix of computing, memory, and storage 
components. Existing CI management methods, which are heavily heuristic or manual-based, struggle with these evolving challenges. This project 
addresses the complex challenges of CI resource management by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) technologies with human expertise. UIC is a 
federally designated Minority-Serving Institution (MSI). An integrated education plan can strengthen diversity-focused programs at UIC, thus 
promoting greater diversity and inclusion within the scientific community.</p>

<p>The project transitions from managing isolated single clusters to coordinating facility-wide management, orchestrating the entire facility as a 
unified pool of diverse resources for a broad spectrum of applications with various resource requirements. Specifically, it aims to design and 
evaluate an AI-guided framework named AIMCI (Artificial Intelligence for Managing Cyberinfrastructure). Key research thrusts are: (1) developing new 
AI models for predictive analysis of resource usage patterns and user behavior, (2) applying reinforcement learning methods to optimize resource 
management in a complex and dynamic computing environment, and (3) building a discrete event-driven simulator for exploratory simulation of CI 
resource management with human-in-the-loop interaction.</p>
